  <Tooltip>Bring back the F12 Developer Menu</Tooltip>
  <Description>
    This plugin re-enables the old F12 menu that was once available to players, allowing you to tweak a huge amount of rendering and gameplay settings to your preference.

    For example, you can:
      * View all grids, ores and voxel deformations within your sync distance
      * Render grids as a wireframe
      * Tweak postprocessing settings
      * Change character stats
      * Access SE's debugging settings
      * And much more!

    Having the Developer Menu enabled will not affect your ability to play online in any way.
    However, this was intended for singleplayer use and many (serverside) features will not function as expected on multiplayer.

    This menu is not officially supported by Keen Software House; It may contain broken and/or unstable features.
